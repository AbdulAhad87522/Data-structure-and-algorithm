CSC-200L,DSA Lab,"DSA Lab is designed to provide hands-on practice of core concepts in data structures and algorithms. Students implement fundamental structures like arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, and graphs, and learn efficient algorithm design for searching, sorting, and problem solving. The lab strengthens programming logic, improves analytical thinking, and bridges theory with real-world coding applications.",None,None,None,None,None,None,Nazeef Ul Haq,Fall 2025

CSC102L,Programming Fundamentals(Pr),"Programming is an increasingly important skill, whether you aspire to a career in software development, or in other fields. This course is the first in the specialization Introduction to Programming in C, but its lessons extend to any language you might want to learn. This is because programming is fundamentally about figuring out how to solve a class of problems and writing the algorithm, a clear set of steps to solve any problem in its class. This course will introduce you to a powerful problem-solving process—the Seven Steps—which you can use to solve any programming problem. In this course, you will learn how to develop an algorithm, then progress to reading code and understanding how programming concepts relate to algorithms.",Student should be able to design programming logic for complex problems using computational concepts,"Student should be able to develop quality code with software design guidelines, unit testing, coding style and documentation",Student should be able to develop persistence software application using structure and file handling for large number of records,"Student should be able to use arrays and functions, when they implement in-memory software applications with limited number of available memory of records",,None,Samyan Qayyum Wahla,Fall 2025
